		text: "As one of my very first forays into the realm of web development, this project holds a special place in my portfolio. Built under the mentorship of DevMentor.pl, it stands as a testament to my foundational skills and eager approach to learning. Despite being an early endeavor, the website showcases my commitment to creating responsive designs, aptly optimized for various devices through the use of distinct CSS files. My hands-on experience with SVGs and image integrations ensures visuals that are both crisp and scalable. Furthermore, the addition of the gradient effect speaks volumes about my budding creativity, and my ambition to elevate even my initial projects with touches of contemporary aesthetics.",

		image: "./media/icons/projects/pro2.webp",
		text: "Diving deeper into the world of Responsive Web Design, my second project is dedicated to the renowned Juventus Football Club. This website, crafted as a tribute, brings together various elements of web development, notably the integration of iframes and the use of responsive imagery. Visitors are treated to a dynamic grid gallery showcasing players, each enlivened with animations upon hovering. Complementing the user journey is an elegantly designed contact form, where gradients seamlessly merge with images, encapsulating the spirit of the club. Proudly completed for CodeInstitute, the project includes a comprehensive README detailing every intricate aspect of its development. Earning merit for this endeavor was not only a validation of my skills but also an incentive to continually refine and expand my craft.",
